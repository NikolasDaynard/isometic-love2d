# Gelatin City
It is an isometric citybuilder deisigned to be played locally with friends. It only supports 2 people at the moment.

This game is my biggest project to date, because it wasn't just me working on it Jayden, the composer for the game did a great job and I probably couldn't finish it without him.

I opted to leave this game borderless, because the idea is when idle, it rests on your desktop waiting to be played. The game itself has a bunch of cool features and mechanics and is horribly unbalanced, enjoy finding all the quirks and bugs and ultimatly, winning.

I did a ton of spriting for this game and it all is pretty cool in my opinion.
